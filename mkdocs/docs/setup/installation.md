# Installation

If you are using a non-rolling release Linux distro such as Debian or
Ubuntu then you are almost certainly going to have an old version of
mergerfs installed if you use the "official" package. For that reason
we provide packages for major stable released distros.

Before reporting issues or bugs please be sure to upgrade to the
latest release to confirm they still exist.

All provided packages can be found at [https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs/releases](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs/releases)

## ArchLinux

1. Setup AUR
2. `pacman -S mergerfs`

## CentOS / Rocky

Get the RPM from the [releases page](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs/releases).

```
wget https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs/releases/download/<ver>/mergerfs-<ver>.el<rel>.<arch>.rpm
sudo rpm -i mergerfs-<ver>.el<rel>.<arch>.rpm
```

## Debian based OS

Debian/Ubuntu/Raspberry Pi

Most Debian based OS installs are of a stable branch and therefore do not have
the most up to date software. While mergerfs is available via `apt` it
is suggested that users install the most recent version available from
the [releases page](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs/releases).
