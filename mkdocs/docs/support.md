# Support

Filesystems are complex, as are the interactions software have with
them, and therefore difficult to debug. When reporting on a suspected
issue **please** include as much of the below information as possible
otherwise it will be difficult or impossible to diagnose. Also please
read the documentation as it provides details on many previously
encountered questions/issues.

**Make sure you are using the [latest
release](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs/releases) or have tried
it in comparison. Old versions, which are often included in distros
like Debian and Ubuntu, are not ever going to be updated and the issue
you are encountering may have been addressed already.**

**For commercial support or feature requests please [contact me
directly.](mailto:support@spawn.link)**


### Information to include in bug reports

* **All** information about the relevant paths and files: permissions, ownership, etc.
* **All** information about the application making the requests: version, uid/gid
* Runtime environment:
    * Is mergerfs running within a container?
    * Are the client apps using mergerfs running in a container?
* A `strace` of the app having problems:
    * `strace -fvTtt -s 256 -o /tmp/app.strace.txt <cmd>`
* A `strace` of mergerfs while the program is trying to do whatever it
  is failing to do:
    * `strace -fvTtt -s 256 -p <mergerfsPID> -o /tmp/mergerfs.strace.txt`
* **Precise** directions on replicating the issue. Do not leave
  **anything** out.
