# Sponsorship, Donations, Support Contracts

Development and support of a project like mergerfs requires a
significant amount of time and effort. The software is released under
the very liberal [ISC](https://opensource.org/license/isc-license-txt)
license and is therefore free to use for personal or commercial uses.

If you are a non-commercial user and find mergerfs and its support valuable
and would like to support the project financially it would be very
much appreciated.

If you are using mergerfs commercially please consider sponsoring the
project or purchasing a support contract to ensure it continues to be
maintained and receive updates. [Reach out for more
