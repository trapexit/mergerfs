# Tweaking Performance

`mergerfs` is effectively a filesystem proxy and therefore its
theoretical max performance is that of the underlying devices
(ignoring caching performed by the kernel.) However, given it is a
FUSE based filesystem working from userspace there is an increase in
overhead relative to kernel based solutions. That said the performance
can match the theoretical max but it depends greatly on the system's
configuration. There are many things which can impact
performance. Device speeds and latency, network speeds and latency,
concurrency and parallel limits of the hardware, read/write sizes,
etc.

While some settings can impact performance they are all **functional**
in nature. Meaning they change mergerfs' behavior in some way. As a
result there is really no such thing as a "performance mode".

If you're having performance concerns please read over the
[benchmarking section](benchmarking.md) of these docs and then the
details below.

NOTE: Be sure to [read about available features](config/options.md)
before changing them to understand how functionality will change.

* test theoretical performance using `nullrw` or using a ram disk as a
  branch
* enable [passthrough](config/passthrough.md) (likely to have the
  biggest impact)
* change read or process [thread pools](config/threads.md)
* toggle [func.readdir](config/func_readdir.md)
* increase [readahead](config/readahead.md): `readahead=1024`
* disable `security_capability` and/or [xattr](config/xattr.md)
* increase cache timeouts [cache.attr](config/cache.md#cacheattr),
  [cache.entry](config/cache.md#cacheentry),
  [cache.negative_entry](config/cache.md#cachenegative_entry)
* toggle [page caching](config/cache.md#cachefiles)
* enable `parallel-direct-writes`
* enable [cache.writeback](config/cache.md#cachewriteback)
* enable [cache.statfs](config/cache.md#cachestatfs)
* enable [cache.symlinks](config/cache.md#cachesymlinks)
* enable [cache.readdir](config/cache.md#cachereaddir)
* disable `posix_acl`
* disable `async_read`
* use [symlinkify](config/symlinkify.md) if your data is largely
  static and read-only
* use [tiered cache](usage_patterns.md) devices
* use LVM and LVM cache to place a SSD in front of your HDDs
